- 👋 Hi, I’m @theonlypandagod (Atlas!)
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of programming!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, PCS, JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: not sure, throw something my way!
- 📫 How to reach me: find a good mossy knoll and call my name 3 times (or email/DM)
- 😄 Pronouns: they / them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm actually a history major, not CS!
