- 👋 Hi, I’m @theonlypandagod (Atlas!)
- 👀 I’m interested in all kinds of programming! Learning Python, want to learn Ruby, R, and JS. Maybe C++ later on, just for fun.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, PCS, JS
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: not sure, throw something my way!
- 📫 How to reach me: find a good mossy knoll and call my name 3 times (or email/DM)
- 😄 Pronouns: they / them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm actually a history major, not CS!

- "So, why History and CS?" Since a lot of museums are (beginning to) modernize and digitize their archives, there's a HUGE opening for multifaceted individuals with both programming and Historical Analysis experience. I get this question a lot, figured I'd answer up-front! Right now, museums are dying for tech support and database builders for their archives: keeping history alive longer! Still doesn't beat having a physical collection, but makes history more accessible.
- "What got you into programming?" My dad, actually! He's an electric engineer (whole different circus, I know), and got me playing around on LearningPit/PSIM and circuitboards from a young age. I was never super interested in doing exactly what he did, but the 0's and 1's behind it? ABSOLUTELY. I started out on Scratch and NG, like any other early-2000s "women in STEM" programmer, and moved from there.
